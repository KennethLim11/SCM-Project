# SCM-Project
This is the final project for module 2 wherein we will connect a metamask wallet to a front-end website.

## Description
Here I modified the index.js file only. Two new functions were added.
1. depositAmount() - allows user to deposit their desired amount of ethereum.
2. withdrawAmount() - allows user to withdraw their desired amount of ethereum.

Front end css styles were also added to the code. 

The rest of the code remained as is, the other functions shown provide the functionality and process of the program. 

## Getting Started

### Installing and how to run program
After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.
After this, the project will be running on your localhost. Typically at http://localhost:3000/
